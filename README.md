## Introduction
A grammar is a set of structural constraints for creating phrases. We use it every day in conversations and each language has it's own grammar. This also means we can create our own set of rules and create phrases that adhere to those defined rules. This is exactly what this project is about. The focus here will be on stochastic grammar, or grammar with some 'randomness' or probability in the rules. The goal will be to make a framework for creating stochastic grammars and using that framework to compose grammars showing different applications in game development.
